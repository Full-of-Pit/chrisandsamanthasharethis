      <h3>Ahoy Woifey-Ho!</h3>

        <h4>Colors that might give your eyes cancer</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="mainText">
        <p>Oh Woifey! So, first off all, take a look at the background of this article. The color
          is called 'lightcoral' and I've seen it on Codecademy a few times already now, and it's
          always looked quite nice... But as a background color for an article here, it might very 
          well count as a carcinogen... <br>
          So, in this article, I was practicing a specific technique to order stuff on a webpage.
          The idea is, that you create a grid with customized column and rows and you than place 
          your objects like text or pictures in specific cells of the page. I used a different 
          technique in the article before this one, but I have to say, I prefer a grid a lot. 
          Perhpas I just think in grids :D (Well, thinking in lists, arranged in grids) <br>
          Well, anyway. I have curated a few funny gifs behind doors number 1 through 5.
          All you have to do is to hover your cursor over the gifs and you can see them.
          Since I'm doing this on a Saturday evening, you will get the rest of the article 
          tomorrow. Enjoy! <br>
          Lovestest, <br>
          Doggo.

        <h3>Woifey!</h3><br>
        <p>You are getting closer to 29!</p>
        <p>But don't worry, you are not going to ever reach doggo
          because you're going to stop aging at 29. Right?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>So, instead of a card you are getting an article on your own
          website woifey!
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li>How modern is that? Saves paper and therefor
              water and energy.</li>
            <li>It can be designed any way I want!</li>
            <li>Fuck the card industry and their designers!</li>
            <li>Lists! You don't get that on a card...</li>
            <li>You get gifs and videos!</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          So, I hope you like your VERY special birthday "card".
          Just that you cannot really call it a card this way...
          Anyway!
          <br>
          All the bestest!

      <h3>Ahoy, Woifey-wife</h3>
      <p>So, Codecademy wants me to do a little side project and it would actually fit here quite well (I think) <br>
        The project is about picking a few colors, fonts and font-size settings etc., and writing a small website section for it
        so you have all the specific settings on hand. I figured this was a good idea to add them here so you can also have a look
        and for me to work on my skills.
