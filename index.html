        <h3>Woifey!</h3><br>
        <p>You are getting closer to 29!</p>
        <p>But don't worry, you are not going to ever reach doggo
          because you're going to stop aging at 29. Right?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>So, instead of a card you are getting an article on your own
          website woifey!
          <br>
          <ol>
            <li>How modern is that? Saves paper and therefor
              water and energy.</li>
            <li>It can be designed any way I want!</li>
            <li>Fuck the card industry and their designers!</li>
            <li>Lists! You don't get that on a card...</li>
            <li>You get gifs and videos!</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          So, I hope you like your VERY special birthday "card".
          Just that you cannot really call it a card this was...
          Anyway!
          <br>
          All the bestest!

      <h3>Ahoy, Woifey-wife</h3>
      <p>So, Codecademy wants me to do a little side project and it would actually fit here quite well (I think) <br>
        The project is about picking a few colors, fonts and font-size settings etc., and writing a small website section for it
        so you have all the specific settings on hand. I figured this was a good idea to add them here so you can also have a look
        and for me to work on my skills.

      in a knick over that.
